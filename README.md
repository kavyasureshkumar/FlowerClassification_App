# FlowerClassification_App
This project uses a dataset which has 12753 training images and 3712 validation images, with 104 classes. In the training data each class has data ranging from 18 to 500 images. The pre-trained models used to train are

1. EffecientNetB0
2. MobileNet

These models have been used for size. Since the other models that were trained and the data are too large to be uploaded in github, they can be found in the following link:
